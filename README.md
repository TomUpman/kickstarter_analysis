# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	The purpose of this assignment was to utilize the skills we developed in the Excel
	unit in order to notice potential patterns, and utilize those patterns to help with 
	future projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	While I was unable to get my line graph to show this, the data (as well as the
	provided example of what the line graph was supposed to look like) showed that the 
	most success came with a launch date in late spring, to early summer.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	I was also unable to get my line graph to look precisely like the provided example,
	however this one was considerably closer. The data showed that the outcomes were
	considerably better at lower goals and, with a minor exception, were consistently 
	worse the higher the goals were.
	
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	I was unable to get my line graph to match up with the example. With that being said,
	I used the formulas in the directions, and the provided "hint" to work through any 
	difficulties that I ran into.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. An launch date from May-July typically leads to high levels of success.
	2. Launching in December is a 50/50 shot for whether it will succeed or fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	It is fairly clear that the best way to meet your goal is to set a lower goal.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The data did not show any potential mitigating factors, such as weather or quality.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	1. A graph showing any correlation between Avg Donation, Run Time, and Success.
	2. A table showing the Success, whether it was a Staff pick, and the particular year.
	3. A table showing whether it was a Success/Fail and the relationship with the 
	particular currency of donation.
